Homework for the seventh lesson

**task1** We created abstract class "employee" with the fields "jobTitle" and "jobTitleCode", and we created interface 
"Printable" which specifies the behavior for displaying the job title. Abstract class "employee" implements interface
"Printable". Also, we created classes "Director", "Accountant" and "Worker", which extends abstract class "employee". 
Class "Runner" begin test program which requests a job code from the console and displays the job title on the screen.

**task2** We created abstract class "GeometricFigure" which extends by classes "Circle", "EquilateralTriangle" and 
"Rectangle". Abstract class "GeometricFigure" contains field "figureName" and two abstract methods: "calculateSquare" 
and "calculatePerimeter". Classes "Circle", "EquilateralTriangle" and "Rectangle" contains fields to describe the 
parameters of the corresponding Geometric figures, and implements abstract methods "calculateSquare" and 
"calculatePerimeter".
Class "Runner" begin test program which creates an array of 5 different figures, loops through the array and displays 
information about each figure, and also displays the sum of the perimeters of all the figures in the array.
